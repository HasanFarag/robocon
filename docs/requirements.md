# Project Requirements

## Competition Brief

### Project Brief 2017

### Functional Requirements

A remote controlled robotic vehicle is to be designed to take part in a competition
called Robocon. The robotic vehicle must be no larger than 0.3m x 0.3m. 
Some clearance will be required so the vehicles dimensions should be smaller than this.
There is no height restriction for the vehicle.

The vehicle will need to be capable of autonomously navigating it's way through a maze
To prevent vehicle learning a route prior to competition, the maze will be of substantially 
a different design each time the competition is held and for each rehearsal. 

After completing the maze the vehicle should be remotely controlled and driven towards a target. 
The vehicle must be capable of firing ping pong balls at the target.

### E1 - Electrical/Electronic Specifications 

#### E1.0 -Power supplies
The maximum voltage of any power supply shall be 12V. Power supplies on board the vehicle must be DC.
Up to two separate power supplies are permitted.

#### E1.1 - Circuit Protection and Safe Isolation

Suitable fuse protection must be incorporated to minimize the risk of damage to 
electrical and electronic circuits.

A safe means of isolating all electrical equipment from the power supply shall be provided.
This isolation mechanism must be easily accessible and permit operators bring an uncontrolled vehicle
to a safe stop.  

#### E1.2 Motors

Motor circuits shall be electrically separate from all other systems.   
 
•	Max Dimensions 300 x 300 mm with no height restriction but clearance will be required so should be smaller than this.
•	Max voltage 12DC (but up to two separate power supplied are permitted) looking at 12 DCv 7Ah as of cost and performance these will be provided by the college.
•	Controller can be selected.
•	Max current draw for each motor 2A
•	Max Pneumatic supply max pressure: 1Mpa (10bar) This must be monitored electrically and locally.
•	Each robot can only carry a maximum of 5 table-tennis balls at a time.
•	Teams must produce at least one PCB and use at least two different manufacturing processes 
•	Robots must have an emergency stop pneumatic vent should be included with this
•	Robots must have at three indicator lamps or displays to add visual effect
•	The full system should be no more than 10kg for safe handling.
•	The ball has a diameter of 40mm and a weight of 2.7g. These will be supplied
•	Removal link needs to be easily accessible to isolate all power.
•	Fuse Protect must be included on all electrical components
•	Motor circuits need to be electrically separate from all other systems.
•	Safety systems should be included on the cannon.

Tasks
Each team will have to negotiate the course and then attempt to hit the target: No team member may enter the unattended operation zone or the wireless remote control zone.
Part One: The Maze
The robot must negotiate a course\maze.  
Part Two: Scoring 
The robot must then attempt to win by firing ping pong balls at the target.  Each maze will have a target mounted on the far-side of the maze that they should be aiming to hit, position of this target is not known beforehand. There will be a line on the floor which the robot will not be allowed to cross. The operator must be in control wirelessly.  If there are no direct hits within given number of balls will affect the marking for accuracy.
Dead Line
System to be completed by 1st week in May.
